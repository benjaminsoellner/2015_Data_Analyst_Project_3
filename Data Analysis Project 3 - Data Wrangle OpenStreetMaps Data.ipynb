    "##Abstract\n",
    "This paper describes describes the process of downloading, analyzing and cleaning of an OpenStreet Map data set of my former home town as a student: [Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden), a state capital in eastern Germany, [a baroque town beautifully located on the board of the river Elbe](https://www.google.de/search?q=dresden&newwindow=1&es_sm=122&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAkQ_AUoA2oVChMIrc3d_cT3xwIVh2fbCh3Y6QYu&biw=1920&bih=969) and town home to a high-tech conglomerate from the micro-electronics sector called [Silicon Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Saxony).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, first, the pipeline (and python script) to perform retrieval, analysis and cleaning of the data is introduced (chapters [Approach](#Approach)) and results of the analysis stage are presented (chapters [Data Format](#Data-Format), [Descriptive Statistics](#Descriptive-Statistics), [Data Quality](#Data-Quality)). Especially during the Descriptive Statistics analysis, interesting facts of Dresden are uncovered, like the most popular religion, sport, beer, cuisine or leisure activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the cleaning stage, canonicalizing phone numbers present in the data set was the challange of choice, since the originally proposed method of cleaning street names was not applicable for this data set (chapter [Cleaning Phone Numbers](#Cleaning-Phone-Numbers)). The paper is finally concluded with some further ideas (chapter [Conclusion and Further Ideas](#Conclusion-and-Further-Ideas))."

    "##The Approach\n",
    "I implemented retrieving / storing / analysing and cleaning in a python script. The script can be called like so:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# python project.py\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "  python project.py -d    Download & unpack bz2 file to OSM file (experimental)\n",
    "  python project.py -p    Process OSM file and write JSON file\n",
    "  python project.py -w    Write JSON file to MongoDB\n",
    "  python project.py -f    Audit format / structure of data\n",
    "  python project.py -s    Audit statistics of data\n",
    "  python project.py -q    Audit quality of data\n",
    "  python project.py -c    Clean data in MongoDB\n",
    "  python project.py -C    Clean data debug mode - don't actually write to DB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Different options can be combined, so ``` python project.py -dpwfsqc ``` will do the whole round trip. During the process, I re-used most of the code and data format developed during the \"Data Wrangling With MongoDB\" Udacity course. For example, the data format used for storing the data (```-p``` and ```-w``` option) is completely based on [Lesson 6](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud032/l-768058569)  - with some fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some output of the script is shown on the terminal, some is written to local files. If a file is written, this is indicated in the terminal output. A sample of the script's terminal output is included in the ```output_*.txt``` files included in the submission."

    "##Data Format\n",
    "**Note:** Use ```python project.py -f``` to obtain the data for this chapter. This is a long-running process which might take a few hours to complete! There is an output file written to [```Project/data/audit_format_map.csv```](Project/data/audit_format_map.csv) which can be beautified into an [Excel spreadsheet](Project/data/audit_format_map.xlsx).\n",
    "\n",
    "![A picture of the excel spreadsheet audit_format.xlsx](audit_format.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the data format was audited, which consisted of going through all the documents and aggregating the occurence of any attributes and the prevalence of their types (```str```ing, ```int```eger, ```float``` and ```other```). For this, batches of 1000 documents each are retrieved from the collection and each combed through by the python code while a Python Dataframe keeps track of the counters. Since there are 1,360,000 elements, this process takes many hours; an alternative would be to run the query natively in JavaScript code on the MongoDB shell or to issue the command as a BSON command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overview of the format showed no obvious big problems with the data at first glance but provided valuable insights for further analysis, especially to query [Descriptive Statistics](#Descriptive-Statistics). Some further interesting insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One area of improvement could be the phone number, which is scattered across multiple data fields (```address:phone```, ```phone``` and ```phone_mobile```) and was identified as a potential candidate for cleaning (see [Auditing Phone Numbers](#Auditing-Phone-Numbers) and [Cleaning Phone Numbers](#Cleaning-Phone-Numbers)).\n",
    "* Also, it is evident that some values are present in the dataset as sometimes ```str```ing, othertimes numeric: The XML parsing process takes care that each value is, whenever parsable, stored as integer or float. For attributes like street numbers, mixed occurences may be in the data set.\n",
    "* This automatic parsing of ```int``` or ```float``` turned out to be not always useful: a problem are leading zeros which in certain cases hold semantics. For german phone numbers, a leading zero signifies the start of an area code (```0```) or the start of a country code (```00```). For german postcodes, a leading zero in a postcode represents the german state of Saxony. As an outcome of this insight, I changed the parsing routine of the XML data to only parse values as numeric, if they do not contain a leading zero (```not s.startswith(\"0\")```)\n",
    "* I checked some of the lesser-common values for sanity. E.g., there is a parameter ```dogshit``` which appears three times. As it turns out, this is not a prank of some map editors, who document dog feces they find in the area, but an indication about whether a public trash can contains a dispenser of plastic bags for relevant situations."

    "\n",
    "A couple of basic MongoDB queries were run to explore the data set based on the knowledge of its format from the previous chapter. The queries produce mostly rankings of values for certain data fields. Some of them are subsequently also visualized in a ggplot graph (png file) drawing on the skill set gained in [Udacity's Intro to Data Science course, Lesson 4: Data Visualization](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud359/l-692548568) while not too much effort was put in making the graphs look particularily beautiful.

The following code snipped uses a MongoDB query with regular expression which returns all street names <u>not</u> ending with a particular suffix like ```[Ss]traße``` (street), ```[Ww]eg``` (way) etc. This is accomplished by a [\"negative lookbehind\"](http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html) regex at the end of the regular expression: ```(?<!...)```, which essentially \"looks back\" at a position inside the text whether any text preceeding the current position <u>does not</u> match a predefined string. Using multiple of those lookbehinds in sequence allows to match exactly those street names, which do not match any of the predefined suffixes."

    "##Conclusion and Further Ideas\n",
    "Overall, the data set of Dresden is pretty neat and tidy. Compared to other, huger cities (e.g., in India), it dawned me when I looked at the Udacity forums, that I had an easier job. There are certainly some other ideas one could venture into:\n",
    "* The users might be analyzed further: Why are so many nodes (many thousands) created by so few users? Are bots at work?\n",
    "* Auditing for completeness would be another challenge: Here, we would need another data set as a \"gold standard\". One could parse several websites for Dresdens street names and test, whether they are present in the data set.\n",
    "* The report also hints at the possibility to formalize the taxonomy of restaurant cuisines and use a more strict classification method of cuisines. However, areas of art (be it culinary, musical or otherwise) sometimes resist strict classification.\n",
    "* One could, of course, feed the normalized phone data back into Open Street Map by either using a Web Service or using the XML format."
